# Tutor Time

A web application using the MVC model for a student's academic support team to communicate about the student's needs. Currently developed for teachers and tutors only, there are plans to expand user registration to parents and guidance counselors. The application is designed with simplicity in mind. Tutors are able to register their students to their account and teachers are able to register their classes. Teachers can send messages to tutors of individual students or messages to the entire class. Similarly, tutors are able to keep notes on student's progress that the teacher can access. 

## Getting Started

Please go to the link for [Tutor Time](https://boiling-beyond-23362.herokuapp.com/) deployed by Heroku. You will need to email a copy of your class information to bewitchedfencer@gmail.com so that the data can be pre-loaded for the teacher side. Allowing for teachers to upload their own files is a future development.

### Prerequisites

You will need a complete roster of your students and the classes they attend. Additionally we will need a list of the teachers and all of the classes they teach.
